/**
 * Lets a plain `node` test import app modules by their `@/...` alias.
 *
 * Node strips the types out of a .ts file on its own, so a test needs no build
 * step, but it does not read tsconfig, so `@/lib/foo` means nothing to it and
 * the extension the alias omits has to be put back.
 *
 * Register it from the test:
 *
 *   node --import ./scripts/alias-loader.mjs scripts/whatever.test.mjs
 *
 * A module imported this way must write its type-only imports as
 * `import type { ... }`. Node erases types but cannot know that a plain
 * `import { SomeType }` was one, so it looks for a runtime export that is not
 * there and the import fails.
